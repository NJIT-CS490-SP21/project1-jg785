Project 1, Mileston1 - Jhon Garcia

Programs used to do this project: Python, HTML, CSS and some knowledge using terminal.
Imported: requests, os, random, load_dotenv and find_dotenv from dotenv, Flask, render_template from flask
API used: Spotify.

I encountered some problems when I was trying to align my text to the center. I also had some problems when I was
trying to fetch the right data and last but not least when my website was not updating the colors and text at all.

I would love to improve my HTML and CSS skill since this could make a simple project like this one
so much nice looking.

You will need to do the following:

1. Create an account at https://developer.spotify.com/ free or premium.
2. Create an App and get the Client ID and Client Secret.
3. Create .env in your directory
    Add lines:

    export ID='YOUR KEY'
    export SECRET='YOUR KEY'

ID is the clientID and SECRET is the client secret from spotify API website developers.
